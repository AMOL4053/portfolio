  <div id="abc"><center>For my SY BCA mini-project, I developed an Online Hotel Management & Food Ordering Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides a seamless user experience for customers to explore the hotel’s gallery, contact the hotel, and place online food orders with ease.
The homepage features an attractive UI with a modern gallery section showcasing the hotel’s ambiance and dishes. The food selection and ordering section allows users to browse through a variety of menu items, add them to the cart, and place an order online. Additionally, the contact section enables users to get in touch with hotel management for inquiries and reservations.  
This project enhances online food ordering by offering an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing website, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for users.

1.Convenience: Customers can browse the menu, place orders, and make payments from anywhere, anytime.
2.Increased Sales: An online ordering system can boost sales by reaching a wider audience and offering special promotions.
3.Better Customer Experience: A user-friendly interface with a gallery and contact section enhances customer engagement.
4.Efficient Order Management: Orders are processed quickly, reducing errors and improving service speed.
5.Marketing & Promotions: Businesses can use the platform to promote discounts, special deals, and new menu items. </center> </div> <br>

  <div id="abc"><center>For my TY BCA final-year project, I developed an Online Waste Food Management Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This platform is designed to efficiently manage surplus food by allowing users to sell or donate excess food while ensuring it reaches the right people.

    The website includes a homepage with a modern UI, providing an overview of the platform’s mission. It features user login, admin login, and guest login, making it accessible to different types of users. A food selection and selling section allows users to list available food items, while a map section helps track food deliveries in real time. The delivery boy section ensures smooth transportation of food from donors to recipients. Additionally, the contact section enables users to connect with administrators for assistance.
    
    This project aims to reduce food waste, promote sustainability, and help those in need by creating a streamlined, user-friendly platform for efficient food management. </center> </div>
